## 🚀 Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was recently migrated from Create React App (Webpack) to **Vite** for improved performance and development experience.

*   **Core Framework:** [React v18](https://reactjs.org/)
*   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Fast HMR & Optimized Builds)

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

### Automated Deployment Script
We use a custom shell script to handle building, committing, and deploying in one go.

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**What this script does:**
1.  Prompts for a commit message.
2.  Commits all changes to the `main` branch.
3.  Pushes to GitHub.
4.  Runs `bun run build` (Vite build).
5.  Runs `bun run deploy` (or `gh-pages -d build`) to publish to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Manual Deployment
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
bun run build
bun run deploy
```

## 🛡️ Linting & Code Quality
